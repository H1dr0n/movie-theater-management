- Set ticket price
- Browse Movies

#### **Customers** can:

This is my university project of semester L1T2. The project was very exciting for me as a beginner and I enjoyed every millisecond of it. There are still some minor bugs while deleting and then browsing the movies. Hopefully someday I'll fix ðŸ˜Š.
